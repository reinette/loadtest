# Loadtest examples

Occasionally I'll post tests here that are sanitized but have commonly-performed actions. Future tests will include OAuth2 and JWT.

Current examples:

1. Multisite.jmx - Shows managing testing a multisite with different URLs. Also some json stuff. All Drupal.

2. APIExample.jmx - A test that includes juggling APIs, a bunch of logic (if/while statements), and some beanshell scripting. This test was a collaboration amongst many colleagues.
